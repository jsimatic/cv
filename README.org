#+Title: Curriculum Vitae

* About

English and French paper version of my curriculum vitae, based on modercv. See
online CV at http://vizualize.me/jsimatic.

* Usage

I use ~latexmk~ to build the tex files. See config in ~.latexmk.rc~. To build
all PDFs, use:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
latexmk
#+END_SRC

During editions, the continuous preview of ~latexmk~ is very useful : When a
change is detected, the new PDF is automatically recompiled. Use:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
latexmk -pvc cv_<LANG>
#+END_SRC

Where ~<LANG>~ is either ~en~ (English) or ~fr~ (French).

Generated files can be erased with ~latexmk -c~ (do *not* removes PDFs) or
~latexmk -C~ (removes PDFs).

* TODOs

1. Separate business and academic versions
   - Academic :: PhD in education, second page with publications
   - Business :: PhD in employement, sigle page
2. Separate primary author and co-author publications
3. Better internationalization
