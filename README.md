# Curriculum Vitae

## About

My curriculum vitae:

* English version: Typical business 1 page CV. Based on [MagicalCV](https://github.com/aaraomelo/MagicalCV) by Aarao Melo Lopes
* French version: Academic 2 page CV with full publication list. Based on moderncv.

See online CV at <http://vizualize.me/jsimatic>.

## Compilation

```sh
latexmk
```

See `.latexmkrc` for config (uses XeLaTeX as template is not compatible with pdflatex).

## TODOs

1. Separate business and academic versions
   * Academic: PhD in education, second page with publications
   * Business: PhD in employement, sigle page
2. Separate primary author and co-author publications
3. Better internationalization
