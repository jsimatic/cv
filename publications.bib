  Abstract                 = {Asynchronous circuits are interesting alternatives for implementing ultra-low power systems but they are more challenging to design. This work provides methods for designers to specify, verify, and implement self-timed pipelines. The connection of standard primitives allows specifying a control circuit. A method to derive a Petri net based model of this circuit is presented. The modeled transactions are only those necessary at a high level for the circuit verification and performance analysis. Additionally, the proposed framework includes merge and split choice structures in the control circuit for further reducing the power consumption of the targeted systems. It is associated with a design flow which uses standard EDA tools. The paper presents two practical examples illustrating how this framework can be used to design low-power systems based on a datapath specification: a finite impulse response (FIR) filter and an advanced encryption standard (AES) cipher. The obtained asynchronous FIR is 20\% smaller and consumes 30\% less energy compared to the synchronous design. The obtained asynchronous AES is 2\% larger but consumes three times less energy than its synchronous counterpart.},

As power is mainly connected to the processing activity and data volume, the level-crossing sampling scheme offers a simple way to reduce data volume and consequently processing activity. Nevertheless, these good properties could be constraining for the designers because of the non-predictable sample number that can be involved in the processing. In this paper, we target a FIR filter architecture and show how to correctly size its input shift-register. This paper shows a strategy to choose the shift-register depth but also a way to dynamically adapt the computation to an heterogeneous data flow.},

This flow takes advantage of level-crossing sampling schemes and asynchronous circuitry. Event-driven paradigm allows better-than-worst-case performance during periods of high-activity of the captured signal as well as a natural stand-by during low-activity periods. The proposed flow uses the specific knowledge of the targeted application and its signals, and a high-level description of the processing algorithm to synthesize a dedicated analog-to-digital converter, which performs the level-crossing sampling, and a digital signal processing unit. The latter is synthesized thanks to a high-level synthesis algorithm following a control/datapath decomposition style. The asynchronous control part is based on distributed asynchronous controllers while the datapath remains similar to a synchronous datapath.},

  Abstract                 = {This work is a contribution to enhance the signal processing chain required in modern systems. The idea is to take advantage of the interesting features of both event-driven and well-established uniform sampling and signal processing algorithms. In this context, authors have proposed original windowing techniques for the event-driven sampled signal, activity selection and local parameter extraction. These are called as Activity Selection Algorithms (ASA). The proposed techniques correlate the windowing function length, shape and resampling frequency with the input signal time variations. In this paper, the ASA and an adaptive rate resampler with zero order interpolation are implemented in C. Using high level synthesis tools, synchronous and asynchronous register transfer level descriptions are synthesized on a commercial CMOS 40 nm technology. The synthesis results are presented. A comparison of the average power consumption between asynchronous and synchronous implementations is made. The proposed system functionality is also verified with the help of analytic test signals. Results have shown a compression, in terms of samples, of 1.5 to 1.6 respectively compared to the simple event-driven level-crossing sampling and by 5.8 to 9.3 compared to the uniform sampling based systems. The asynchronous (resp. synchronous) implementation of ASA and resampler only consumes in average 28pJ/sample (resp. 238 pJ/sample).},

The other more-concurrent scheme proposition leads to a 25\% area reduction and a 40\% improvement of the maximum pipeline throughput.},

The new trends and needs of faster, smarter and smaller internet connected systems, also known as the IoT, require developing very-low power embedded systems including actuators, sensors and signal processors. In this paper, we focus on the architecture optimization efforts to reduce the required activity using the FIR filter as a demonstration example. The new optimized implementation of the FIR filter was compared with other synchronous and asynchronous FIR filter versions realized using the ALPS framework developed at TIMA laboratory. The obtained FIR architecture exhibits 43\% less area and up to 61\% power consumption reduction compared to the best previous synchronous implementation. We plan to use these results to improve the automatically generated datapath of the high-level synthesis tool of our framework (ALPS-HLS).},
